In two weeks I'm leaving a Director position I've held for the past 17 months. In fact, I'm leaving management completely. It's a bit of a fluke that I was offered, and took, a management job at all. The distinct moment after I accepted where the very distinct realization hit me that I had no idea how to be a manager is still clear in my memory. Impostor syndrome set in rather forcefully. However, I quickly realized that, while I didn't have any experience or even thoughts about how I would operate as a manager, I had **years** of exposure to what **not** to do. With regret over past uncharitable thoughts and words, I've learned greater sympathy for the individuals in leadership chains through my experience walking in their shoes. Leadership is extremely difficult. No small amount of disfunction and perceived incompetence can be explained by the social dynamics that exist within leadership hierarchies. Nevertheless, focusing on what *not* to do set me on strong footing.

Over the past four years I've learned a lot about leadership and my departure from the management ranks seems a fitting impetus to commit what I've learned to text. However, the massive amount of (often conflicting and unrealistic) content out there claiming to be authoritative that exists to sell books, conferences, and consulting engagements makes me hesitate to write anything. It's impossible to write such content without some air of arrogance, I suppose. But, this blog's purpose, to solidify my own learning and clarify my perspective through the act of writing, is explicitly selfish. I encourage you, reader who no doubt stumbled upon this post, to read what comes next with the skepticism the 'leadership self-help' industry has earned.

I've concluded that while leadership is difficult, it is not complex. The fact that we think it is complex is the root of many organizational failures. I conclude that the role of leadership is simply this:

## Set clear goals

If you set a goal and cannot concisely and conclusively state how you will evaluate someone in the completion of that goal, you have not achieved clarity.

There are more than one way to avoid clarity:
- Clear, but competing goals
- Immesurable goals
- Incommunicable goals

Ensure that vision, strategy, and tactics align.

**Drive tactics as far 'down' as possible** 

## Put the right team on the field with the resources they need

## Establish a framework for decision making
**Be explicit with assumptions**
**If people are making bad decisions, it's probably because they are following rules you set.**
**Change with discipline.**
#Align incentives#

I've also come to rely on a set of principles which have become guides for conducting myself as a leader. Leaders spend a great deal of time trying to understand and direct an organization. Without guiding principles these efforts become directionless and arbitrary. Leadership is also 

### Principles of leadership
**It's always leadership's fault.**
**Don't control, govern.**
**Leave your ego at the door**
"No one advances in management without being motivated at least a little by status."
**Always remember that you are in a bubble**
"You should know your team's needs."
**The higher you rise, the fewer decisions you should make.**
**No one is qualified to lead another human being.**
**Change with discipline.**
**People, not resources.**
**Remember that you don't do anything, nor should you**
**Lead from behind.**
**Above all, establish trust**
**Value clarity above all else**
**Your principles are always under attack.**
- Servant leadership
**You work for your team as much, or moreso, as your team works for you.**
**Completed work is a terrible philosophy**


### Lessons learned
**People want to succeed**
**Most multiple choice surveys are next-to-useless**
Management likes them because they can be turned into metrics. It's a classic example of letting practices impede effectiveness.

### What employees should know
### Your leaders may not be as incompetent as you think they are

### What good leaders wish their team members knew
