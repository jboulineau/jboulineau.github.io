Eighteen months into our major architectural project my boss emailed me. "Has someone beat us to it? Should we stop?" He had come across a platform that sounded an awful lot like what we were doing. I didn't like the question at all. But, looking at the platform he identified, I struggled to answer 'No.' This platform that I had never heard of seemed to do 80% of everything we had ambitions to do. And it turned out it was discovered not by my boss or our architecture team, but by a Vice President over a business unit.

This project was one I had wanted to work on for years. It was going to fix major underlying problems that plagued data engineering in enterprises the world over. We were going to unleash capabilities of which our BI-driven organization had only dreamed. It was ambitious. It was difficult. It used all the new hotness coming out of the Silicon Valley unicorns. It had all the factors for which die-hard technologists like me live. 

The Cloud is one thing. Integrated cloud services are an entirely other thing.

We can still make the argument about vendor lock in.

Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have figured out that Cloud vendors


The build vs. buy dynamics are shifting as vendors adopt practices that mitigate the old arguments against them.

'Wait for IT' is simply not accepted anymore. This is partially because of business demands, but also because of newfound confidence on the part of those uninitiated into the IT fold. The concept of 'Power User' has been around for decades, but that category is both broadening and deepening. More and more meetings with my business stakeholders sound like technology user group meetings. 

Agile influence

The expertise divide has never been healthy. Human nature is such that expertise is at once admired and distrusted. As Arthur C. Clark observed, "any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.

The truth is, the frontiers are becoming more and more rarified. Distributed systems, now all the rage, are complex in ways about which all but those within the higher ranges of intelligence have difficulty reasoning. 

Self-tuning databases
ML-enabled tools and platforms
AI-as-a-service

Computational thinking?

We are destined to work ourselves out of a job.

Our drive is to make things easier, to discover the unifying abstraction, to automate all the things.
