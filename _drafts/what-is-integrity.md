categories: leadership
excerpt: For years I've talked about having integrity, but it wasn't until recently that I truly understood what that meant. I thought I had integrity. I'm not so sure anymore.

"He must be going through a really tough time." I was flabbergasted. Sitting across from my peer and friend who was being daily lambasted by his boss, in a drawn out exercise of removing him from the organization, and hearing these words come out of his mouth was surreal. These were difficult times. In an organization beset with the perfect storm of high-cost investments, baggage of past (perceived and actual) work failures, conflict within the senior leadership ranks, increasing competitive pressures, an operating model buckling under work demands and competing ideologies, and processes wholely inadequate to organize the [__chaos__], this situation was a microcosm of what swirled around us. Somewhere along the line it was decided that my friend was to blame for what ailed our corner of the org, and he was hearing about it. Often. Yet within that tempest, amidst the frustration, fear, and confident-shattering criticism, here he was expressing deep, genuine concern for what his boss was going through. 

Integrity challenges pragmatism. Test

Obligatory 'the [Dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/integrity) defines _integrity_ as':

>1. adherence to moral and ethical principles; soundness of moral character; honesty.
>2. the state of being whole, entire, or undiminished: to preserve the integrity of the empire.
>3. a sound, unimpaired, or perfect condition: the integrity of a ship's hull.

And we all nod. But, what does it mean **_really_**? Itegrity is defined by the characteristics that, without which, we would no longer be who we are. Or, perhaps, who we are supposed to be.

So, here's what I'm struggling with now. What are the unchangable principles on which I stand, regardless of the cost? For what will I sacrifice everything? Until I know that, can I claim that I have integrity? I conclude the answer is 'no.'
